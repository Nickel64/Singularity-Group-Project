# Comp313 Project 2: Game Prototype
Programmers: Nicholas Snellgrove, Brandon Scott-Hill, Jack Porter
Design Team mate: Vivian Chen, Justin Cage, Victor Francis

### **Note - Please use Unity version 2018 1.6f1**

## Concept
This prototype, named "Singularity", is set in space, at a small mining station which has fallen under attack from an unknown entity. 
As the entity and its forces attack the station, the player must defend it at all costs, and find some way of stopping this singularity.
The player controls a single starfighter, and must defend the station against waves of enemies.  
The presence of this entity causes wormholes to open up in the area, which will teleport the player between them if they fly into one. These can be used to make a quick getaway, or get the drop on an unsuspecting foe.

## Setup
You should just be able to run the appropriate file (.exe for Windows), and be straight into the main game. 

## Instructions
W: Thrusters forward
S: Brake
A/D: Bank Left/Right
Left Mouse Button: Fire Autolaser
Right Mouse Button: Fire Rocket
Mouse Up: Pull Ship up
Mouse Down: Ship down
Mouse left: Ship turn left
Mouse Right: Ship turn right

Escape: Pause game/unpause game
From the pause menu, you can resume, goto main menu, and quit the game using the buttons. 

**Shooting works with target locking with red box your aim to move the recticle over the target lock box**

**Bonus: Try moving the mouse to one side, then quickly moving it back to the other side. If you get it right, you can do a little barrel roll!**
